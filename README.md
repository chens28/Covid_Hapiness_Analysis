# Covid_Hapiness_Analysis

In this project, I used Python to analyze COVID-19 data and explored any potential relationships between the spread of the virus and other happiness life factors in various countries. Steps included preprocessing and merging datasets, calculating necessary measures, and visualizing the linear relationships. Below is an example of the relationship between maximum infection rate and life expectency.
